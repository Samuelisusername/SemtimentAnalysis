ust like in sports, being motivated at work is crucial for your performance. This rings especially true when you have a looming deadline, an important meeting, or colleagues or customers depending on your performance.

Think about the last time felt generally unmotivated. What brought you out of that feeling? Sometimes all it takes is a good night's sleep or seeing the fruits of your labor to fire you up. Still other times, you might listen to someone say something that resonates with you -- that alters the way you've been looking at a particular task or problem.

Motivational speeches and speakers can come in all different forms, but this is the one thing they have in common -- resonance. They hit the right listener at just the right time and in just the right way. Who knows, maybe this article is doing a bit of that for you right now ... (I can dream, can't I?)

To help you stay motivated, no matter what your job throws at you, we decided to compile 24 of the best motivational speeches from business, sports, entertainment, and more. If you want to get fired up for a project, watch these videos.

Trust me, I was wiping my eyes after I saw them. And while the messages vary from speech to speech, they will put you in the optimal frame of mind for tackling and crushing your next big challenge.
